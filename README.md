## Why?

### How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

#### Webpack

To bundle the javascript and Babelify i have chosen Webpack since its so powerful and can do most
things any task runner can. Since React gives you a clear starting point for the application. Webpack
is the perfect fit.

#### Bootstrap

There are nothing like inventing the wheel too many times. Everyone with the label web/front/iu-developer
has heard of and/or used Bootstrap. So easy to get started with no threshold of learning an other developers
way of building components.

#### Jest

Jest is just elegant and easy, it scales really good with react for building more complex tests in the future
without any additional packages. Jest is also super fast, no one like to spend a minute waiting for the tests to pass.
